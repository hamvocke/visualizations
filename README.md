# Visualizations

Different visualizations I scripted in SVG and others. More of a Spike repository than anything to show off.

## Contents
  * **Pyramid**: Draws a pyramid with a flexible amount of layers
  * **Progress Circles**: Draws a set of circles with pulsating animation
  * **Progress Box**: Draws a box that gradually fills up
